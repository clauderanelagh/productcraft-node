Full README audit against the live API: documents both caller contexts (PlatformUser admin on `/v1/workspaces/{workspaceId}/...` vs customer-backend on `/v1/communities/{communityId}/...` with the `X-Acting-As` header), expands the quick-start with a "post on behalf of an EndUser" example, and adds a Common-Operations section covering posts + feeds, stories, social graph, notifications, direct conversations, and moderation. Notes that Agora's wire is snake_case both at the DTO level and in TS types (no name translation layer for this surface).
