`FlagsClient.state` is now `unavailable`, not `stale`, when a download fails and the client has never held a config (no earlier download, cache or bootstrap). `stale` keeps its meaning: the last download failed and an older config is being served. Evaluations are unchanged (your default, with `PROVIDER_NOT_READY`). If you `switch` on `state`, add a case for `unavailable`. The OpenFeature and React packages accept `@productcraft/flags` 0.3.
